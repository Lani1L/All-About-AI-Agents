# All-About-AI-Agents
This repository is all about building an AI agent and some best practices to build a reliable AI agent that can help you and the business to automate task.

ðŸ¤–  **What Are AI Agents?**

AI agents are intelligent software assistants that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, they often use machine learning and natural language processing to adapt and respond dynamically.

ðŸ§   **What is LLM(Large Language Model)?**

LLMs are AI system trained to understand and generate human language across a wide range of task.
These models are trained on massive amounts of text â€” everything from books and websites to code and conversations â€” so they can learn how language works in practice.
There are a lot of LLMs, and for sure there will be more to come. Choosing the right LLM for your needs is essential to creating a reliable and effective AI agent.

_Below are some of the leading and most trusted LLM providers, along with the models they currently offer._

**OpenAI**

OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT and the GPT series. They operate both as a research lab and a commercial platform, offering it's model through API and product integrations.
OpenAI focuses on building general-purpose GPT chatbot models with broad capabilities.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- GPT-5 - is the most intelligent model offered by OpenAI. Best for Advanced reasoning and logic.
- GPT-5 mini - Affordable reasoning and logic.
- GPT-4.1 - Complex tasks without advanced reasoning.
- GPT-4.1 mini - Balance of power, performance, and affordability.
- GPT-4.1 nano - Speed and price optimization
- GPT-4o - Multimodal tasks(text, images, audio)

**Anthropic**

Anthropic is an AI company based in San Francisco, founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI researchers.The team focuses on building language models that are safe, steerable, interpretable, and reliable in longer conversations.
Their Claude family is known for strong instruction-following and context retention, values that show up clearly in how the models handle nuanced prompts and multi-turn conversations.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 - is now considered by Anthropic to be the best model for coding and the best model for all-around performance.
- Claude Opus 4.1 - is still preferred by many developers for complex coding tasks and is also well-suited to research and enterprise applications that need maximum performance.
- Claude Haiku 3.5 - is optimized for speed and affordability.

**Google DeepMind**

DeepMind is Googleâ€™s AI research division, originally known for breakthroughs in games and reinforcement learning. It's now the team behind the Gemini model family, which powers many of Googleâ€™s AI products.
Gemini models are built for multimodal reasoning and long-context tasks, and are already integrated in their ecosystem like Search, YouTube, Drive, and Android.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- Gemini - is the most intelligent model offered by Google DeepMind. Gemini 2.5 models are capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy.
- Gemma - A family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models.
- Veo - state-of-the-art video generation model.
- Imagen - leading text-to-image model
- lyria - latest music generation model

**Meta**

Meta is the company behind the LLaMA models â€” some of the strongest open-weight LLMs available today.While access is gated under license, the models are fully downloadable and commonly used for private deployments and experimentation.
Metaâ€™s focus has been on releasing capable models that the wider community can fine-tune, host, or build into systems without relying on external APIs.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- Detectron 2 - platform for object detection and segmentation
- DensePose - Designed to map all human pixels of an RGB image to a 3D surface-based representation of the human body
- Seamless - SeamlessM4T is a foundational speech/text translation and transcription model that overcomes the limitations of previous systems with state-of-the-art results.
- Llama - Shaping the next wave of innovation through access of Llama's open platform featuring AI models, tools, and resources.

**DeepSeek**

DeepSeek is a China-based AI company that has quickly gained attention for releasing competitive open-weight models with a focus on reasoning and retrieval.Their models are popular among developers looking for transparency and control in how their systems are built and deployed.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- DeepSeek-R1 - Advanced reasoning, complex logic, high-level mathematics, sophisticated code generation, real-time decision-making, and viewing the model's chain of thought. 
- DeepSeek-V3 - General language understanding, creative writing, and robust coding tasks. 
- DeepSeek Coder - Specialized coding tasks.
- DeepSeek-VL2/Janus-Pro-7B - Multimodal applications, processing various types of media. 
- DeepSeek-V2 - High performance with lower training costs. 

**Mistral**

- Mistral is a Paris-based AI startup known for releasing high-performing, open-weight models. Their work focuses on efficiency and accessibility, with models often used in local or low-latency deployments.

Below are the Top models they currently offer.

- Medium 3 - Delivering a range of enterprise capabilities including hybrid or on-premises / in-VPC deployment, custom post-training, and integration into enterprise tools and systems.
- Magistral - Complex thinking, backed by deep understanding, with transparent reasoning you can follow and verify. The model excels in maintaining high-fidelity reasoning across numerous languages, even when switching between languages mid-task.
